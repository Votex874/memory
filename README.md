Game of matching cards. The logo of the cards presents different languages and frameworks. We have three levels to choose from: easy, medium, difficult.We also have the option of passing the game on time. By entering your nickname, your time will be saved to a simple database.At the moment, if you want to use the database you need to install and run your own json server.

## USED 
* React JS 
* ES6
* SASS
* WEBPACK
* JSON SERVER 

### IN FUTURE
I would like to create a database based on mongoDB. At the moment I'm learning node js with express js and mongoDB. So that the user does not have to run the json server by himself.

#### HOW TO RUN YOUR OWN JSON SERVER
* we need to install the server, we use the command for this `npm install -g json-server --port 3001`
* we must create a db.json file or download it from here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YLiMuXMDZLWdLyu_Ptl-A8KpXZDmKTdH
* if you create db.json file you need to paste content from the link above
* when you have the file ready, use this command `json-server --watch db.json`
* This is what the message from the console should look like
